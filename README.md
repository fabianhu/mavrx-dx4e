mavrx-dx4e
==========

Custom firmware for the Spektrum DX4e (may work on DX5e)

The fabianhu version is focused on blade nano flying without expensive RC.

Set the "mix" dip switch to on for "Nano mode"

DSMX only for now, but see comments for other frame formats.

Aux is throttle hold, Bind is the kill switch.

Hold bind at turning on for bind mode. Press Bind for "Kill engine", unlock with Aux. Hold bind and toggle rate 4x = range test. Hold bind and toggle rate 10x = learn stick center (center all sticks and trim in advance)

To download the new Firmware, set all dip-switches to the upper position, otherwise the SPI lines are connected to GND. Leave the fuses, as they are.

If you manage to download the original Firmware, let me know (the lock bit will be set, that's for sure)
